            <p>Clothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on the body. 
                Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made 
                from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. 
                The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. 
                The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations.

                Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, 
                rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a 
                barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothing can insulate against cold or hot 
                conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. 
                It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. 
                Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. It may be used to prevent glare or 
                increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats.
