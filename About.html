        <h3>Women's Clothing</h3>
        <p>Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, 
            sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin 
            and the environment. Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a 
            hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. It can protect 
            feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. Clothing also 
            provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. It may be used to prevent glare or increase 
            visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats.

        <h3>Men's Clothing</h3>
        <p>
            Clothes for men has become a big business, it has moved from the men's tailors to men's clothing 
            retail chains and boutiques, and now online clothes shopping has made life easy for the busy executive. 
            abof, an online fashion retailer (''all about fashion'') has decided that its target audience ranges 
            between the ages of 18 to 35. This being a discerning age group, the clothes need to be of the latest 
            fashion trend, the fit good, the prices competitive, and the 
            turnaround time between order and delivery as short as possible

        <h3>Kids Clothing</h3>
        <p>
            Just like adults, kids have specific preferences for what they put on. Some like to 
            wear colourful and funky clothes while others prefer more comfortable and no-fuss clothes. 
            Several clothing companies now offer a wide range of trends and fashions that are better 
            suited to what kids want to wear and that also perfectly complement their personalities 
            and the adventurous spirit that is characteristic of kids.
            Clothing for babies and young children should be casual, and modern, with a variety of 
            patterns, designs, prints, fabrics, and colours, 
            and made from materials that are nice, useful, and cosy.
